Quantitative social scientist working at the intersection of data science, financial services and political economy. Most recently, I worked as an analyst at <a href="http://variantperception.com/">Variant Perception Research</a> in London, forecasting macroeconomic trends and asset prices in R. I'm also completing my PhD at
<a href="http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> under economic historian <a href="http://stephen-haber.com/">Stephen Haber</a>, researching the impact of political instability on countries' public finances. This involves collecting and describing lots of cool, hard-to-find economic data from the 1960s, and is mostly an opportunity to make nice plots with ggplot. Comments very welcome!
